# ChaYe Kube

### Purpose
A project aimed at creating a small home Kubernetes cluster using Raspberry Pi 5s, and plan to run using
NixOS for better potential scaling beyond 4 Pis.

### Reason
Kubernetes is a very important and interesting piece of container orchestrating software that I personally
wanted to learn. This projects serves as both a way of building a cool piece of hardware, while learning
Kubernetes, and further honing of my understanding of NixOs and my 3d modeling skills in Fusion 360.
